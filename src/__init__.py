# This file exists as as pytype did not like it when I imported from
# "pdf_to_anki_cards_converter.py" and wanted me to import from either
# ".pdf_to_anki_cards_converter" or ".". Without this __init__.py I would get 
# an "attempted relative import with no known parent package" error when doing
# either of those.
